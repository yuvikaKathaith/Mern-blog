            I am committed to staying updated with the latest trends and technologies in the field of web development. I actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills through online courses, tutorials, and practical projects. My goal is to build a solid foundation in front-end development and eventually explore full-stack development.
            I am excited to apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects while continuing to grow as a web developer.
